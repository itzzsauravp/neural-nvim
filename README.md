# neural nvim

This is my personal neovim configuration. 

vibecoded because i was tired of 'pro' configs, this just includes the bare minimum to get started and organizes everything very cleanly

## Essential Keybinds
These are the only keys you really need to know to move around:

| Keybind | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Ctrl + /` | Toggle Terminal |
| `Ctrl + h/j/k/l` | Switch Windows |
| `Ctrl + Arrows` | Resize Windows |
| `<leader> ff` | Find Files |
| `<leader> e` | Toggle File Tree |
| `jk` | Escape to Normal Mode |

you can find and edit these to your likings from the `keymaps.lua`
